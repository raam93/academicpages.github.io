## Summary:
We studied the topical preferences of social media campaigns of India’s two main political parties by examining
the tweets of 7382 politicians during the key phase of campaigning between Jan - May of 2019 in the run up to
the 2019 general election. First, we compare the use of self promotion and opponent attack, and their respective
success online by categorizing 1208 most commonly used hashtags accordingly into the two categories. Second,
we classify the tweets applying a qualitative typology to hashtags on the subjects of nationalism, corruption,
religion and development. We find that the ruling BJP tended to promote itself over attacking the opposition
whereas the main challenger INC was more likely to attack than promote itself. Moreover, while the INC
gets more retweets on average, the BJP dominates Twitter’s trends by flooding the online space with large
numbers of tweets. We consider the implications of our findings hold for political communication strategies
in democracies across the world.
