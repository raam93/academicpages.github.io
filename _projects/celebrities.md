## Summary:
Democracies around the world have different levels of dependence on influencers outside of mainstream politics in their outreach efforts. In this study, we examine the case of India, specifically the relationship between politicians in power and “influencers”, such as celebrities and media accounts, they follow on Twitter. We find that while politicians engage with these accounts to the same degree to which they follow them, the media accounts at the highest levels of engagement share the same ideology as the politicians who follow them. No similar alignment exists between celebrities and politicians, which requires future work of analyzing the content of engaging tweets in order to define the extent to which these accounts have political influence.

**[Update]:** We examined the engagement of 1412 popular Indian celebrities and 2000 Indian politician accounts on Twitter to explore relationships between politicians and public figures in the digital landscape, and their impact on message propagation. We find that the incumbent, right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been more effective than its opposition rival the Indian National Congress (INC) in organized outreach to celebrities, effectively leveraging official positions to engage celebrities without explicit partisan appeal.
