I work at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) as a SCAI Centre Fellow with [Amit Sharma](http://www.amitsharma.in/) and [Joyojeet Pal](http://joyojeet.people.si.umich.edu/) *([SCAI:](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/scai/) Societal impact through Cloud and Artificial Intelligence)*. My research focuses on [fairness in socio-technical systems](http://sorelle.friedler.net/papers/sts_fat2019.pdf) in the space of governance and politics. Broadly, I'm interested in the following questions:
* **AI in Governance:** How machine learning systems when introduced in the governance process influence outcomes and how they can be leveraged to generate desired outcomes.
* **Political Outreach:** How political actors construct narratives around specific topics and engage with selected public figures to define their image and influence the elections.
