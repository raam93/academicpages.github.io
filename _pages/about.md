I work at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) as a SCAI Centre Fellow with [Amit Sharma](http://www.amitsharma.in/) and [Joyojeet Pal](http://joyojeet.people.si.umich.edu/) ([SCAI:](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/scai/) Societal impact through Cloud and Artificial Intelligence). I research on [fairness in socio-technical systems](http://sorelle.friedler.net/papers/sts_fat2019.pdf) in the context of governance and politics. In particular, I'm interested in the following questions:
* **Politics:** How social media platforms provide an affordance for politicians to construct a narrative around specific topics and engage with selected public figures to define their image both online and offline.
* **Governance:** How machine learning systems when introduced in the governance process influence the outcome and how they can be leveraged to generate desired outcomes.
