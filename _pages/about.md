My research interests lie in the area of [fairness in socio-technical systems](http://sorelle.friedler.net/papers/sts_fat2019.pdf) along the following two axes:
* **Interpretability:** Developing fairness-aware machine learning algorithms and explainability tools.
* **Social Networks:** Understanding socio-cultural factors in influencing information flow and allocation of resources within networks of people.
