I work at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) as a SCAI Centre Fellow with [Amit Sharma](http://www.amitsharma.in/) and [Joyojeet Pal](http://joyojeet.people.si.umich.edu/) ([SCAI:](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/scai/) Societal impact through Cloud and Artificial Intelligence). I research on fairness in socio-technical systems in the context of governance and politics. 

I received my Masters in Artificial Intelligence from [KU Leuven](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/studeren/master-artificial-intelligence), Belgium. My masters thesis focussed on effectively employing insights from interpretable predictions and educational
psychology to decrease the student dropout rates in Belgium. Previously, during my bachelors in Instrumentation and Control engineering from [NIT Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/ice/), I have worked on robotics and computer vision.
