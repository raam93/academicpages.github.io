Hello! I'm a self-motivated learner who loves to engage at the intersection of computational and social sciences. I'm primarily interested in studying [fairness in socio-technical systems](http://sorelle.friedler.net/papers/sts_fat2019.pdf) and in building rigorous foundations for the design of end-to-end fair ML systems, from data collection to deployment. 
 
I currently work as a Data Scientist at [Everwell Health Solutions](https://www.everwell.org/). Previously, I was a pre-doctoral [AI Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/scai/) Fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) where I worked with [Amit Sharma](http://www.amitsharma.in/) and [Joyojeet Pal](http://joyojeet.people.si.umich.edu/) 

In the past, I have worked on optimizing incentive schemes for spreading public awareness messages in the [Learn2Earn project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/learn2earn/#!publications) and have developed open-source software to [explain](https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE) ML models. Further, I have also explored the role of sociocultural factors in online political communication in India, and have studied the relationship between caste hierarchy and controlling information flow within [online social networks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/social-media-and-society/#!publications) of Indian MPs.
